â€œIâ€™m a first-year Mechanical Engineering undergraduate student at Siirt University. Self-taught front-end developer. Mastering four languages. Having a passion for The Fourth Industrial Revolution, this passion has given me the ability to learn programs for a multitude of things, including AI, robots, programming languages, electric cars, and databases.


I enjoy solving technical problems, researching and developing new technologies, designing software applications for different platforms.

 I enjoy meeting people and working with them in a team environment. I also enjoy interacting with clients and customers. My strong customer service skills allow me to do this well. I am a quick learner with a fun, outgoing personality. In addition, I excel in my ability to work under pressure and handle stressful situations very well.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Python
